00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,759
I'm on my course-collaboration-travel-plans,

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,448
a project that I forked from Lahm's here.

3
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:09,780
And so, I want my changes to be in this project- in her project.

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,204
So I need to send a pull request.

5
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:15,474
Good thing there's a new pull request button right here.

6
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:19,425
This is the page where we were able to start a new pull request.

7
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:22,439
So this is showing us my master branch,

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,554
on my repository, compared to the master branch on Lahm's project.

9
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:30,210
Right now there isn't anything to compare because both of

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,325
these branches are pointing to the exact same commits.

11
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,609
So let's switch my branch to the new branch that I just pushed.

12
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,240
So let's go over this one more time,

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,115
because this area right here can be a little bit tricky.

14
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:44,545
This is my project and my branch,

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:50,020
and I'm comparing this change with Lahm's project and her master branch.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,410
And the changes between her master branch and my branch right here are listed down below.

17
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:58,919
There are three commits on my branch that aren't in her master branch,

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,179
and two files have changed.

19
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:04,129
These are the commits and down here are the files that have changed.

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,394
So in this css file these lines were added,

21
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:10,719
and in the index file these lines were added.

22
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,599
Let's scroll back up here,

23
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,119
and now we can just click on this create pull request button.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,935
So the view has changed a little bit.

25
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,510
Now, we're presented with this form here,

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,120
where we can actually send the pull request.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,859
We have the pull request title right here,

28
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:29,010
which you can see is populated from the same name as the branch name.

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,265
So this is another reason why you'd want to name your branches with descriptive names.

30
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:38,010
I think this is a good pull request title so I'll leave that as is,

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,590
and I'm going to write a little message.

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,859
Now, this area down here supports markdown.

33
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:44,894
This looks good to me,

34
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:48,329
so let's scroll down here and click on the create pull request button.

35
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,679
Notice though, we have now switched away from my project and my page,

36
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,850
I am now on the udacity account,

37
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,280
but looking at Lahm's project.

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,530
And instead of being on the code tab,

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,915
this has switched to the pull request tab,

40
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:06,195
and it is showing us the conversation here.

41
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,658
Now the conversation includes a little bit of information:

42
00:02:08,658 --> 00:02:11,729
The message I've provided and the commits that I pushed.

43
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,539
And we can see those commits in more detail here.

44
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:16,199
And then if we want to look at the actual files

45
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:18,524
that have changed- we can see that on this tab.

46
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:21,330
Let's switch back to the conversations tab.

47
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,590
Scrolling down, we can see that this branch has no conflicts

48
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,724
with Lahm's base branch or Lahm's master branch,

49
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,294
but we can't do anything with this,

50
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:31,849
we need Lahm to be able to include

51
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,775
these changes- to include this pull request in her master branch,

52
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:39,000
because she owns this repository.
